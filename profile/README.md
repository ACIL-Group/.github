# Welcome to the ACIL-Group

This is the GitHub group for public repositories developed for the **Applied Computational Intelligence Laboratory** (ACIL) of the Missouri University of Science and Technology (S&T) in Rolla, MO USA.

## Who are we?

We are a group of faculty and graduate researchers affiliated with the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department at Missouri S&T.

## What do we do?

We work in the space of machine learning research, focusing on clustering and neural networks algorithms, and our specialty is in the study of engineering applications of these techniques.

We in particular specialize in a class of machine learning algorithms based upon Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART), a biologically plausible theory of how fields of neurons autonomously regularize their learning through competitive dynamics.
To learn more, feel free to check out the myriad projects and software packages under this GitHub group.
